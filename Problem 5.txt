The `smallest_multiple` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the 
smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to `n`.

We start with `i = n` and increment it by `n` until we find a number that is 
divisible by all numbers from 1 to `n`. We check if `i` is divisible by all numbers 
from 1 to `n` using a generator expression and the `all` function. If all the 
remainders are 0, we return `i`.
