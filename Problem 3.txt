This code defines a function `largest_prime_factor` which takes an input
number `n`. It then iteratively checks for the smallest prime factor and divides `n`
by that factor until `n` becomes a prime number itself. Finally, it returns the largest
prime factor.

The code uses a while loop and checks divisibility of `n` by `i`, starting from `2`. If
`n` is divisible by `i`, it divides `n` by `i` and continues the loop. Otherwise, it 
increments `i` and continues checking.

After defining the function, we set `number` to the given value in the problem
description, and then call `largest_prime_factor` with `number` as the 
argument. The result is stored in the variable `largest_factor`.
Finally, we print out the result.
