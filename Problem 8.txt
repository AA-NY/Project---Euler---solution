The `largest_product` function takes two arguments: an integer `n` and an 
integer `k`. We first convert the integer `n` to a list of its digits using a list 
comprehension. We then loop through all the possible starting positions for a 
sequence of `k` digits, and calculate the product of those `k` digits using another 
loop. We keep track of the largest product we have found so far, and return it at the 
end.

In the test case, we use the given `n`-digit number as a string, and set `k` to 13 (as 
specified in the problem statement). The function returns the largest product of 13 
consecutive digits in the number, which is 23514624000.
